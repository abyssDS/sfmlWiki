Tested with SFML 2.1 and recent git snapshots.

This very simple class will read in a list of all available audio files from the directory path it is constructed with and will then allow you to create playlists out of all those files. You can choose to add just a few songs in specific order or all songs and then shuffle them. Playlists can be set to loop or just play through songs once.

Comments and criticism is welcome.
