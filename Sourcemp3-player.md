# Mp3 Player
<a name="top" />
By MickaGL

Works exclusively with the latest revision of SFML 2.

Here is a class using the library [mpg123](http://www.mpg123.de/index.shtml) which allows playback of MP3 files.  
Works on the same principle that sf:: Music

Attention, decoding MP3 files is subject to strict licensing and is paid as part of a non-personal use.
