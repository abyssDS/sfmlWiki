# Basic Game Engine
<a name="top" />
The following is the start of a basic game engine intended for beginners and experienced developers to start from.  As time permits, I will add important features to this game engine and mention their uses in the [[Basic Game Engine|Tutorial:-Basic-Game-Engine]] tutorial wiki.  Originally this Wiki included all the source code, but since that time, the source code has been moved to its new home at [[GQE Project|http://code.google.com/p/gqe/]].  Please download the latest source code from there.  Also, you may need the stdint.h file shown below if you're using Visual Studio 2008 or lower since the GQE requires this file.  Credit would be appreciated but not required.  Please send me an email to my nick GatorQue in the forums if you have questions or recommendations.  Thanks and please don't hesitate to suggest improvements.

## <a name="30" />stdint.h [ [Top] ](#top)
If you are using Visual Studio 2008 or lower, you will need this file.  It defines the uint32_t, int32_t, and other typedef's.  Gcc and other compilers provide this file (since it is part of the C/C++ standard).

## <a name="comments" />Comments [ [Top] ](#top)
Please leave your comments here or if you would appreciate a quick response, email my nick GatorQue in the forums.

Jmgr - You should put your getters const. To allow settings getters const and using a mutex, simply set your mutex as mutable by putting this keyword before his declaration.

eXpl0it3r - First of all a BIG thank you for the code and the tut! I don't know if you've ever run that script, but for me there're a lot of errors coming out of the compiler...
e.g. missing MenuState.hpp & SplashState.hpp or map error in ConfigReader.hpp and there seams to be many errors related to closing brackets and semicolons };
I'll try to fix somethings, but is there a fully working source? :-)

GatorQue - I have fixed all the compiler issues that I can find.  I also provided the MenuState and SplashState classes as examples of creating simple State classes.  I will add the CONST flags to the Getters/Setters in the near future.

eXpl0it3r - Thanks for the fix! It really works now! =)
Your code is for the SFML Version 1.6, I started playing around with v2.0 and had to make a few fixes for that, I ziped and uploaded it to this link:
http://www.rapidshare.com/files/443403165/GQE.zip Just in case someone would like that too. ;-)
Btw I've spotted a not relevant mistake, in MenuState.cpp and SplashState.cpp it's named in the comment section as .hpp instead of .cpp ;-) THX

GatorQue - I fixed the comments in the two State files and added the ability to add Inactive states to the StateManager class.  This allows you to add a bunch of states, whose Init will only be called when they become active.  The advantage to adding states as active is that their Init function will immediately be called, which might trigger the AssetManager to load certain images, sounds, etc.  If you want these assets to not be loaded, until the state becomes active, then add the state as an Inactive state.

jinho - Hi, wanted to say thanks so much for posting up your code, it's been really enlightening! This may be a stupid questions, but I was able to compile GQE, but when I try running it, it states that it can't load "MenuImage.png" and "SplashImage.png" - I put them in the same place as GQE.exe but they don't seem to do anything - I simply made the two images to be red and blue 1024 x 768 pngs, but they don't seem to load. What am I doing wrong? Where should the game assets be placed? Thanks!

GatorQue - The issue with the assets not loading is probably because your using Visual Studio to launch the program right after compiling.  When you launch the program from within Visual Studio it will usually use the "solution folder" as the working directory.  If you edit the properties of your project you can change the "Working Folder" under the "Debugging" category to "$(OutDir)" to force Visual Studio to use the folder of the executable as the working directory.  You could also put the assets in the same directory as your "solution file" too.

Mars_999 - Where can one download the whole project as a single .zip file for version 1.6? I see eXpl0it3r made a 2.0 project... Thanks!

GatorQue - Your in luck!  The GQE project can be downloaded from the GQE Google Code project here http://code.google.com/p/gqe/.  I will try and keep both the code above and the GQE project about the same, but eventually the GQE Google Code project will outpace the code above.
