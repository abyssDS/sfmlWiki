Most SFML user run with the pre-built SFML dependencies, either because it's just convenient, or because they don't really know how to build the dependencies themselves. This tutorial should make things a bit easier. For the beginning however it will primarily focus on Windows and if anyone feels like it, they could extend it to other platforms as well.

I have created a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/eXpl0it3r/SFML-dependencies) for it. The documentation/instructions are in [the wiki](https://github.com/eXpl0it3r/SFML-dependencies/wiki) and the repository contains useful scripts, submodules for the various libraries and useful tools.
