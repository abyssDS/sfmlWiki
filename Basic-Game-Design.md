#Basic Game Design#
So you have a new game idea and want to see it come to life but are not sure where to start.  This tutorial is intended to guide you through the process of turning your new game idea into a basic game design and get you well on the path of bringing your game to life.  If while reading this tutorial you find things that are completely wrong or could be improved, please don't hesitate to fix the tutorial.  This tutorial is based on years of designing my own games for fun and reviewing the code base of the PopCap engine and the PlayFirst engine and other tutorial online.  If your experience is from working at a real game company, please share your insights to the rest of us.  That being said, lets begin by discussing Game Ideas.

## <a name="idea" />Game Idea [ [Top] ](#top)
As a youth I'm sure I drove my friends, family members, and school teachers crazy with my constant discussion of my latest game idea.  If you're anything like me, you probably have more game ideas than you have time to explore.  As I matured (i.e. got older), I began to realize that having a game idea, even a good one, is only 1% (or 10% if its a great idea) of the total work involved.  The other 99% is found in putting the design on paper and implementing the game idea.  This is why I decided to create the [[Basic Game Engine|TutorialGQE Engine]] tutorial (and [[GQE project|http://code.google.com/p/gqe/]]) to help myself and others bring their game ideas to life.

I have also learned that many great game ideas are based on very simple concepts or principles.  At the heart of many of the early first person shooter games was a simple maze.  The player navigated the maze not knowing where they were going until they reached the end of the maze.  The next level was simply a new maze to navigate with more monsters/people to kill on the way to the end.  As first person shooter games evolved, the maze became more sophisticated and open, especially the multiplayer first person shooter games.  So as a Game Designer you're objective is to find a game idea that is basic enough to meet your ability to bring it to life.  If you choose a game idea that is too complex for you to implement you will find yourself like me, rarely finishing the games you start.  But before you despair, there are still plenty of variations to existing games that you can implement.  So lets begin our discovery process by discussing Game Genres.

## <a name="genre" />Game Genre [ [Top] ](#top)
As humans (especially the male gender), we like to group things into categories.  Game designers are no exception.  Over the years the game industry has created a list of [[Game Genres|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_genres]], which is just a fancy term for game design categories.  Recently, I have been focusing on classifying my game ideas according to the game genre they fit best and exploring the differences and similarities between my game ideas and other games in the same game genre.  By comparing and contrasting my game ideas to other similar games I can determine if the game is worth implementing in terms of complexity, uniqueness, and overall fun.  With so many "Apps" available, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a new game idea that stands out from the many "me too" applications available.  That is why you must take time to develop your game ideas more fully before bringing them to life.

To help you explore your game ideas better I suggest you create a [[game design document|http://www.reservetokyo.com/jbuffey_gamedocs.zip]].  This document will act as a guide to you and your project members as you implement your game idea.  It will also help you think more deeply about your game idea and figure out the game mechanics to your game early on.  If you're serious about game development, you should be serious about taking time to develop a game design document before you start implementing your games.  Most game companies require this type of document at the very least before entertaining (i.e. paying for) any game idea from their game designers.

Once you have created your game design document, the next step will be to create a basic prototype of the game.  During the prototype phase of game development you create the minimum game structure necessary to implement the core mechanics of the game design.  The first step in creating the game design prototype is to choose a Game Engine style.
