# Introduction

Why build from source?  SFML is under constant revision and improvement.  Bugs in the stable download are found and fixed relatively quickly.  If you encounter a bug in the stable package, chances are it could already be fixed.  

## What if I discovered a bug?

When a bug is discovered it is best to check the [forums](http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/) to either confirm the bug or ask whether what you are seeing could be a bug.  If the condition is determined to be a bug, then it's time to create a new [issue](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML/issues).  Issues should only be created for confirmed bugs.  If you suspect a bug, please use the forums first.

# Setup

This tutorial starts from a clean install of Ubuntu 14.x, other versions may work, but are untested.
